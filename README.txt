This is a collection of functions that can used for the topological description of atomic and molecular materials.

Function _plm in legendre_plm: Calculates the associated Legendre polynomials P_lm(cosθ) for a given angle θ.
Function _ylm in spherical harmonics: Calculates the real form of spherical harmonics Y_lm(θ,φ) for given angles θ and φ.
Function _sop in order_parameters: Calculates the first and second kind of the Steinhardt order parameters for a reference particle with N neighbours
